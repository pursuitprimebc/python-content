'''QUESTION - List mutating operations - This will help you learn the list methods and operations that will modify the list inplace. Note that you should not be creating a new list anywhere in this function.
Create new lists - This will help you learn how to create new lists that resembles the result of above operations but does not affecting the original list.
Set operations - This will help you learn things that you can do with sets'''
