'''Tasks 1  - building up Arithemetic expression
Tasks 2 - floating point arithemetic
Tasks 3 - modulo and floor division
Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation'''

# Sample inputs
a = 5
b = 6
price, discount_percent = 80, 5.75
total_mins = 470

output1 = a+b # int: sum of a and b
output2 = 2*(a+b) # int: twice the sum of a and b
output3 = abs(a-b) # int: absolute difference between a and b
output4 = abs((a+b)-(a*b)) # int: absolute difference between sum and product of a and b

# Find discounted price given price and discount_percent
# input variables : price: int, discount_percent: float
discounted_price = (1-discount_percent/100)*price # float

# Round the discounted_price
rounded_discounted_price = round(discounted_price) # int

# Find hrs and mins given the total_mins
# input variables : total_mins
hrs = total_mins//60 # int: hint: think about floor division operator
mins = total_mins%60 # int
