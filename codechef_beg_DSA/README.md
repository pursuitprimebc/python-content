<h2 align="left">📁 About this folder :-</h2>

###

<p align="left">This folder, Logic Building & Beginner DSA Practice, contains beginner-friendly problems to develop logical thinking and foundational DSA skills using basic math, conditionals, and loops.</p>

###

<p align="left">It features three progressively challenging subfolders:<br><br>- Basic-logic-building: Absolute beginner problems (0-500 rating equivalent) like  digit sums,  simple if-else checks and problems on mathematical operations.<br><br>- Easy-DSA-500-800: Easy-level problems (500-800 rating points).<br><br>- Medium-DSA-800-1000: Medium beginner problems (800-1000 rating points).</p>
