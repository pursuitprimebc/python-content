<h2 align="left">📁 About this folder :-</h2>

###

<p align="left">This folder contains beginner-level DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems from CodeChef , these files contains logical problem-solving approaches. Each file focuses on foundational programming concepts, including basic mathematics operations, conditional statements (if-else), and loop constructs (for, while). These problems help build core skills for tackling simple logical challenges step-by-step, ideal for CS students starting their DSA journey.</p>
