''' QUESTION  -  Avoid Contact
A hostel has N rooms in a straight line. It has to accommodate X people. Unfortunately, out of these X people, Y of them 
are infected with chickenpox. Due to safety norms, the following precaution must be taken:

No person should occupy a room directly adjacent to a room occupied by a chickenpox-infected person. In particular, two chickenpox-infected people cannot occupy adjacent rooms.
For example, if room4 has a chickenpox-infected person, then nobody should occupy rooms 3 and 5. Similarly, if room 1 has a chickenpox-infected person then nobody should occupy room 2.

What's the minimum value of N for which all the people can be accommodated in the hostel, following the above condition?

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y — the total number of people and the number of chickenpox-infected people.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer — the minimum value of N for which all the people can be accommodated in the hostel.

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y = map(int ,input().split())
    if x!=y:
        print((y*2)+(x-y))
    else:
        print((y*2)-1)
