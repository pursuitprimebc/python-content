''' QUESTION - Play Piano
Two sisters, A and B, play the piano every day. During the day, they can play in any order. That is, A might play first and then B, or it could be B first and then A. But each one of them plays the piano exactly once per day. They maintain a common log, in which they write their name whenever they play.

Input

The first line of each test case contains a string s denoting the entries of the log.
Output
For each test case, output yes or no according to the answer to the problem.

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    a = False
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i%2==0:
            if s[i]==s[i+1]:
                a = True
            
    if a==True:
        print('no')
    else:
