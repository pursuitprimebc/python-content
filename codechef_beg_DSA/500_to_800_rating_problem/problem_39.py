'''question - Small factorials
You are asked to calculate factorials of some small positive integers.

Input
An integer t, 1<=t<=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by t lines, each containing a single integer n, 1 <= n <= 100

Output
For each integer n given at input, display a line with the value of n!

Note: For larger numbers, their factorial can overflows any available numeric data type in C.
'''


t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    factorial=1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        factorial=factorial*i
    
    print(factorial)
